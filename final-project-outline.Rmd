## Research Question 

Our project delves into the question of whether there is a correlation between climate and population movement for different countries. When considering all possible reasons as to why people choose to live in certain locations, it is important to consider all contributing factors-- sunshine, tourism, latitude being a few. Seasonal depression and mood-changes based off the weather is a serious impact on many peoples' lives. Applying this knowledge, climate could be associated with certain locations having an increase in population and tourism over time. 


## Data Processing 

#### Data Intake 

##### Loading in Basic Packages

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(rvest)
library(dplyr)
```


##### Sunshine Hours Data
- The *sunshine* data has 392 cases of individual cities across the world and the number of sunshine hours they get for each month of the year. The data also contains the country each city resides in and the total number of hours of sunshine per year. 
```{r}
sunshine <- read.csv(file = 'Sunshine hours for cities in the world.csv')

str(sunshine)
head(sunshine)
sample_n(sunshine, 10)
nrow(sunshine)
```


##### City Latitude/Longitude Data

- The original data set I downloaded was too big for GitHub, so I had to process and wrangle the data in a seperate RScript, save the new csv file and then import it here. I will include images of the coding work I did.
![city_loc intake](city_loc_intake.png)
- This data set is the already wrangled version (image of the wrangling done below in *Data Wrangling* section).
```{r}
city_loc <- read_csv(file="city_loc.csv")

str(city_loc)
sample_n(city_loc, 10)
nrow(city_loc)
head(city_loc)
```  


##### Country Tourism Data

- Another interesting observation about a country and its sunshine hours pertains to tourism rates. If a country is more desirable (by having more sunshine hours [?]) it will bring in more tourists. This data measures the amount of tourism dollars spent in different countries over the course of many years (in US dollars).
```{r}
country_tour <- read.csv("tourism-recipts.csv")

str(country_tour)
sample_n(country_tour, 10)
nrow(country_tour)
head(country_tour)
```


##### City Population Data

- This data set contains city and country name as well as the population of 2022, 2023, growth rate, type (world versus USA), and rank (1 being the most populated city, 778 being the least populated). We plan on using this this table to see the correlation between the amount of sunshine a city gets and its population. We will be using the growth rate so that regardless of the different sizes of cities, we can evaluate the changes in population equally.
```{r}
CityPopulations <- read_csv(file = "world-city-listing.csv")

str(CityPopulations)
head(CityPopulations)
sample_n(CityPopulations, 10)
nrow(CityPopulations)
```


#### Data Wrangling 

Include R code and written explanation for wangling your data (you can make multiple wrangled data sets). 




## Data Visualization

Include R code and written explanation for your data visualization(s) with at least 3 variables. You must have **at least** one graph. You may have more than one (I would encourage you to have more than one). 




## Conclusion

Answer your research question using the data sets and visualizations you created.
